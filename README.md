Toolchain for developing, testing and interacting with Cairo contracts for StarkNet

## Development
### Tools

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) - dependency manager
[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) - recommended for installing and switching python versions locally

Make sure running ``poetry run python --version`` returns ``Python 3.7.12``.

### Setup
Make sure you have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed before running `install`
```shell
# Install dependencies
poetry install
```

### Git hooks

```shell
cp pre-push ./.git/hooks/
cp pre-commit ./.git/hooks/
chmod +x ./.git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x ./.git/hooks/pre-push
```
